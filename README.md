Machine Learning Models for Predicting Photocatalytic Degradation of Phenol Using Graphene Oxide-Based Photocatalysts

**Project description:**

The challenge of wastewater treatment has become more daunting due to the presence of phenol which standing out as a particularly alarming contaminant due to its persistence in the environment and harmful effects on both humans and animals. Photocatalytic degradation offers a hopeful and effective solution for phenol removal. Despite this, a comprehensive kinetic study of photocatalytic phenol degradation has remained elusive due to the multitude of variables involved, their intricate interplay, and the complex nonlinear relationships between process parameters and their resulting effects. To address this shortcoming, the current study aims to establish a sophisticated, data-driven mathematical model that employs machine learning (ML) techniques. The objective is to accurately predict the efficiency of phenol removal in photocatalytic processes using graphene oxide-based photocatalysts. The investigation considers key parameters such as initial phenol concentration, photocatalyst dosage, pH, light intensity, and illumination time. The efficiency of phenol removal is the output variable. To pinpoint the most significant parameters governing photocatalytic performance in phenol degradation, the research utilizes ANOVA as a statistical tool. A careful analysis of 15 prevalent ML algorithms yields the top five performers— XGBoost, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, and Bagging—to predict phenol degradation rates using real-world data. The developed ML model’s performance is gauged using evaluative metrics such as RMSE, R2, and MAE. Results indicate that CatBoost surpassed the other models in the stratified 5-fold cross- validation, achieving an exceptional RMSE of 2.31 and an R2 of 0.99275. Additionally, the research delves into the integration of datasets containing various photocatalysts, discovering that the greatest accuracy is attained for data with two photocatalysts, followed by datasets with three and four photocatalysts. This research underscores the significance of employing ML techniques for predicting photocatalytic degradation rate, which can be extended to a broader array of photocatalysts, pollutants and experimental settings, rendering it an invaluable resource for photocatalysis research.
